# Employee Tracker

## Description 

A very important part of back-end development is creating databases and accessing those through MySQL. In this project, I'll be creating an employee tracker system where you can interact with the databases through node. 

## Usage

To use this app, start by opening up your terminal and typing 'node app' 

A list of prompts will be shown, ranging from simply viewing to adding/updating departments, roles and employees. Click any of the prompts to explore the app.

## User Story

```

```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
